        <h1>The Annoying Quiz: Sequel of Quiz and Questions</h1>
        <p>You seem to have finished Quiz and Questions, but there is a sequel to it. If you think you are capable of
            the tasks in Quiz and Questions, you still might have some difficulty doing this. You can probably think
            this game as the revenge of the Quiz and Questions game in the last level of QAQ (Quiz and Questions)</p>
