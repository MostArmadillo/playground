        <div class="box">1 The answer box is becoming more and more useless, it is not becoming quiz and questions
            anymore it will soon become secret finding.
        </div>
        <Div class="box">2 This is the last <em onclick="why()">quiz and questions level</em>, can you beat it? I know
            this game has said it gets
            harder when you reach higher levels so it is going to an easier game. Anyway here is my question: look at
            box 3

        </Div>
        <div class="box" onclick="truth()">3 YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES <div onclick="answer()">YOS</div>
            YES YES YES I bet
            you are lazy and didn't read all the yes's and didn't notice one of them is actually Yos. I dare you to
            click on the Yos
        </div>
        <div class="box">4 I think question 3 has something suspicious or is it a trap? Anyway how many yes's only are
            in the 3rd box</div>
        <div class="box">5 This word is scrambled and can you unscramble it?: tapoto
