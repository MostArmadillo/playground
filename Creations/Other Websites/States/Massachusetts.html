            <h2> Points of Interest</h2>
            <p> Boston has a trail called the Freedom Trail because it leads to many historic points. The trail can take
                you to many sites that are important to the history of Boston’s African Americans and Irish Americans.
                The start of the Freedom Trail is at Boston Common. It is about 50 acres of open land near the center of
                Boston’s Business District. Further down the Freedom Trail is the State House. There is also Cape Cod, a
                national seashore. The most important point of interest is Plymouth rock because that is where the
                Pilgrims landed in 1620.
            </p>
            <h2> Interesting Information </h2>

                Harbor was home to the first American Lighthouse. Many events that led up to the American Revolution
                happened in Massachusetts like the Boston Tea Party or Boston Massacre. Dunkin Donuts first opened in
                Massachusetts so it is very common in the Northeastern of U.S.

            <h2> My Opinions</h2>
            <p> Before starting this report, I had opinions about the state I chose. This is what I thought: I thought
                Massachusetts wouldn’t have a big history before I started this report.
                Now after completing this report, I think Massachusetts will be popular in the future because of its
                amazing healthcare and education systems. I now also no longer believe that Massachusetts has a small
                history.
